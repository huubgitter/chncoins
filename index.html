<h1>Place Your Page Title with PRIORITY KEYWORDS Here<br>
- It's Good to REPEAT the [TITLE] Tag Again in the H1 Field. By the way, Google LOVES the H1 Tag!</h1>
<p>
Remember that you can use CSS / Style sheets to modify the look and feel of the page, including the H1, H2 Tags.
<p>
Body. Each page needs to have what Google calls 'Good Content.' By that, don't forget that you are writing for real human beings. When they are doing a Google search, they are looking for useful content. Be sure to include your <b>keywords</b>, frequently on the page, but in a correct and normal way.
<p>
With respect to the page's target <b>keyword</b> or <b>keyphrase</b>, you are looking for a <b>keyword</b> density of perhaps 3-7% of the total page. Again, you want it to read like normal English, and embed the target <b>keyword / keyphrase</b> as many times as would make sense. But be sure that there is a correspondence between your target <b>keyword</b> and the page content. After all, you cannot optimize on a <b>keyword</b> if you do not include that in your text!
<p>
<h2>Use the H2 Tag for a Few Less Important Headings - Be Sure to Include Your Keywords</h2>
<p>

<h2>Use the Anchor Tag</h2>
<P>
If needed or possible, build a list of links to other pages on your website and be sure to embed your <b>keywords / keyphrases</b> inside the anchor tags as follows.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="keyword.htm">Keyword1</A> - Here is a description of this <b>keywords / keyphrases</b> that entices the reader to click. Notice how the <b>keywords / keyphrases</b> is embedded inside the A HREF tag!
<P>

<h3>Image Tags - Use Image Tags by Naming Images with Keywords and Using the ALT TXT attribute to contain keywords</h3>
<p>

<p>
<h3>Other Tags</h3>
<p>
Beyond the tags above, and especially in your visible text, use tags like the <b>BOLD</b> and <I>ITALICS</I> tag to indicate the importance of particular <b>keywords / keyphrases</b>. You are trying to tell Google what this page is about, and by placing <b>keywords / keyphrases</b> within the hierarchical structure of page tags you are communicating not just what the page is about, but the priority of individual tags. So place your most important keywords in your [TITLE] tag, follow that by your [h1] and [h2] Tag, etc. In the body, repeat the <b>keywords / keyphrases</b> tag many times, but do not overdo it. <p> Also use <b>pull down</b> lists or <b>comment tags</b> that contain the <b>keywords / keyphrases</b> But as in many things of life, a little is good, and a lot can be bad. So be moderate in your use of keywords vs. page tags and strive for good, well structured, and well displayed content.
